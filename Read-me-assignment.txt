Features:

1. Featured Product
One of the products should have a flag that it's a featured artwork.
It should be displayed above the product list.

2. Product List
The product list should contain 6 artworks. After hovering over the image,
you should display the "add to cart" bar. Remember that some products have
the bestseller flag.

3. Add to Cart
After clicking "Add to cart" in the cart icon in the header should appear
the badge with the counter of elements in the cart. Each 'Add to cart'
action should open the cart dropdown with items. The dropdown should
be also visible after clicking the basket icon in the header. Clicking
in the "Clear" button should remove items from the cart and hide the dropdown.

4. Pagination
Products should be paginated. On one page should be 6 items. The pagination
should show the current page. Hide the 'prev' arrow on the first page and
hide the 'next' arrow on the last page.

5. Sorting
Implement 2 types of sorting: alphabetically or by price. Use basic HTML select.
Clicking on arrows should change the order to 'ascending' or 'descending'.

6. Filtering
Products should be filterable. You can filter products by multiple categories
(multiple filters) and only one price range (single filter).
Using filters should affect the pagination. Try to build filter options dynamically
(don't hardcode them).
